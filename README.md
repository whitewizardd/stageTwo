  The project is built using the following technologies and frameworks:
  Java: The core programming language.
  Spring Boot: A popular framework for building Java applications.
  Spring Starter Data jpa/ jdbc and MySql Driver: Simplifies database access using Java Persistence API.
  Spring Boot Validation: Provides validation for inputs.
  Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code by generating common methods.
  Maven: A build tool for managing dependencies and building the project.

                                                          Project Structure
  The project is built and organized into several packages using one of the most common architectural build, Layered Architecture:
  com/example/demo/controllers: Contains the REST API controllers.
  com/example/demo/data/models: Defines the data models for Person and Address.
  com/example/demo/exceptions: throws and handle all possible exception(s) that might occur while using the program
  com/example/demo/services: Contains the business logic and service implementations.
  resources: Contains configuration files, including application.properties.
  pom.xml: Maven project configuration.

                                                          API Endpoints
  The REST API exposes the following endpoints:
  POST /api: Create a new person record.
  GET /api/{user_id}: Retrieve a person by their email.
